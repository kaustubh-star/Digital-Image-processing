# Histogram Equalization using OpenCV

This project demonstrates **histogram equalization** in Python using OpenCV to enhance the contrast of a grayscale image.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Histogram equalization improves the contrast of an image by redistributing pixel intensity values so that they span a wider range.  
This is especially useful for images that are **too dark** or **too bright**.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python

python kaustubh_hist_eq.py
